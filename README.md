Hill climbing algorithm is a local search algorithm which continuously moves in the direction of increasing elevation/value to find the peak of the mountain or best solution to the problem.
  The Algorithm has a few shortcomings - mainly that it gets stuck on local maximas/minimas.
  This has been overcome by selecting a goal direction randomly from the directions giving equally maximum growth.
  This approach add a stochastic element which help the AI not get stuck on local maximas
